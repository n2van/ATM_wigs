## Additional License Notice: Optional `codeformer` Component

This project distribution optionally includes an old version of a component 
named `codeformer` (https://github.com/felipedaragon/codeformer),
developed by Shangchen Zhou.  
The `codeformer` component is **NOT** licensed under the MIT License. 
Instead, it is licensed under:

**Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**  
License details: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

Key points about this license:
- **Non-commercial use only**: You may not use `codeformer` for commercial purposes.
- **Attribution required**: You must credit the original creators.
- **ShareAlike**: If you modify and share `codeformer`, you must do so under the same license.

### How to Use This Project as MIT Only

If you wish to use this project solely under the MIT License (for example, 
for commercial purposes), you **must remove** the `codeformer` component.  
Please follow the instructions provided below:

- Remove the subdirectories basicsr and facelib
- Remove within weights subdirectory Codeformer and facelib.
- Remove codeformer_wrapper.py
- Edit refacer.py and remove the import: codeformer_wrapper
- Adjust the code so that it doesn't calls the enhance functions from the commented wrapper
- That's all!

Failure to remove `codeformer` when required may violate the terms of its license.

About User Outputs:
The outputs generated by this software (such as refaced images or videos) are not 
subject to the CC BY-NC-SA license and may be used freely, including for commercial 
purposes, regardless of whether the optional codeformer component is used.

Explanation:

Codeformer is a model that processes images for face enhancement. 
It does not embed its own visible content into the output.

This is very different from a case where licensed assets (such as textures, 
overlays, characters, backgrounds, or artwork) appear visibly in the output.

Codeformer simply modifies the input image without adding original copyrighted 
material.

Therefore, output images are not derivative works of Codeformer 
and are not bound by the NonCommercial restrictions of its license.

Only the Codeformer model code and weights themselves are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
 â€” not the results produced through their use.
